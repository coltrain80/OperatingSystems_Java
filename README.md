# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room client requested we develop a web-based gaming application called "Draw It or Lose It". Critical software requirements include having multiple teams with distinct names, having only one game instance exist at any one time, and enabling real-time communication. The software also neededed to be cross platform compatible to reach as many customers as possible, leveraging a client server architecture with cloud strategies. 

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I think my recommended solution was on point, using industry standard technologies that met the Gaming Rooms goals. I also think the document is clear, organized and could be expanded upon further and be used in Agile to define an Epic and stories for engineers to begin building the product. 

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Obviously flushing out business requirements helped me define technical deliverables, which laid the groundwork for the code developed. Understanding constraints up front allowed me to design and then execute a solution that meets business goals. Flushing out pros/cons of different platforms allowed me to select the tools to deliver a product that is technically sound, while meeting all major business requirements.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I'm really proud of this document, but as with anything, I feel like if I spent more time vetting tools and technologies, I might be able to come up with some alternative options that might be more "cutting edge" technology. Going with industry standard approaches is fantastic, but spending more time on innovation and design is fun, and it can lead to a product that saves time, money and engineering cycles. 

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? 
Considering users needs allows a developer to prioritize and build features that meet business requirements. User stories generated from stakeholder inputs represent work deliverables, giving engineers a roadmap to deliver a product that hopefully avoids rework and meets customer satisfaction. In this projects scenario, the customer was clear with their business requirements, which allowed me to craft technical requirements that turned into the work delivered in this project. 

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approach it with several thoughts in mind. First - I want to clearly understand the product vision, business requirements, and scope. This will help me with part two - researching and architecting the application design. I can use the information from my first step as guard rails for my design decisions, taking me time to build a plan and most importantly share it with other engineers for their inputs/critiques. Once I have an agree upon high level design, our next goal is to define and execute a minimum viable product for the application. We should be able to prioritize a few critical features that end-users value, and put together an MVP so I can demo to stakeholders. From here, we gain additional feedback and begin to iterate on our product, creating a build and user feedback loop that helps us mature our application. This methodology will apply to building almost any product, whether its a web-application driven by restful-apis, or a Machine as a Service playbook that configures a Dell Server iDrac (one of my specialities!).
